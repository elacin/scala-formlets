  <h1>Formlets - A Nice Form Abstraction</h1>

  <div class="hero-unit">

    <p>This implementation is inspired by the paper</p>
    <p>The Essence of Form Abstraction by <br />
      Ezra Cooper, Sam Lindley, Philip Wadler, and Jeremy Yallop</p>
    <p><a href="http://groups.inf.ed.ac.uk/links/formlets/">Formlets site</a> and <a href="http://groups.inf.ed.ac.uk/links/papers/formlets-essence.pdf">the paper</a>.</p>

    <p>This file contains the very first parts of a Formlet implementation
in Scala - <strong>It's not usable yet</strong>; I'm simply exploring the idea
at the moment. Please see the <a href="/example" target="_self">Example page</a> for a form that has been created using this project</p>
