# Formlets - A Nice Form Abstraction

Inspired by the paper

The Essence of Form Abstraction by
Ezra Cooper, Sam Lindley, Philip Wadler, and Jeremy Yallop

[Formlets site](http://groups.inf.ed.ac.uk/links/formlets/) and [the paper](http://groups.inf.ed.ac.uk/links/papers/formlets-essence.pdf).

This file contains the very first parts of a Formlet implementation
in Scala - **It's not usable yet**; I'm simply exploring the idea
at the moment.

See the [site](http://lift-formlets.mads379.cloudbees.net/) for examples and more information.
